6. STRETCH: What is a closure, what is it good for and how do you recognize one?

  Your answer: 

  Researched answer: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.


7. STRETCH: What is an API?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.
